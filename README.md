# belly_button_challenge

I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

I used D3 to read in data from an external website, created bar and bubble grphs and a display to show demographic data on each sample. 

I added a dropdown box to sdelect a sample form the large number available and modifiied the code to update the visualizations as different samples werre selected.

I depolyed the visulaizatiosn to a free ststic page hosting service with the url https://jlawrence16.github.io/
